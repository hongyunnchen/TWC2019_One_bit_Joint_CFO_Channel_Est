# TWC2019_One_bit_Joint_CFO_Channel_Est
This folder contains an implementation of our TWC paper on bilinear GAMP-based joint CFO and channel estimation with one-bit ADCs

Instructions to execute algorithm:-

1) After uncompressing the zip file, go to "bigamp_one_bit_joint_est" folder
2) Then, enter "code" folder that contains all the GAMP libraries and PBIGAMP
3) Enter "PBiGAMP" folder and run "joint_CFO_channel_estim.m"

For the infinite resolution case, go through the same steps 1-3, but with "bigamp_inf_bit_joint_est" in step 1.
